Modern Recommendation Systems with Neural Networks


1. Simple Recommender System

Implement a Movie Recommender System in Python:

      1.1 We will develop a very simple movie recommender system in Python that uses the correlation between the ratings assigned to different movies. Thus, we will find the similarity between the movies.
      1.2 The dataset that we are going to use for this problem is the MovieLens Dataset.
